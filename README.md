This is a ML model for Stress Detection Using Facial Image Recognition
The Project Has Two Models :

1. Emotion recognition




3. Stress Level Calculation

Step 1 : Using the Video Capture feature of OpenCV to capture the live image of a Person
Step 2 : Run the 68-landmark facial features file to detect the facial features of the person, In our case its the left-eyebrow and the right-eyebrow
Step 3 : The displacement between the left and the right eyebrow is calculated and normalized using an exponential function.
Step 4 : The Stress Levels are Calculated and Displayed to the User
